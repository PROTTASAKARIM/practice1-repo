            <p>Food blogs used to be a type of personal journal of recipes and short essays about food. Neither the blog
                design nor food photos were very polished.

                A lot has changed since then.

                Somewhere around 2007-2008, gastro blogs began to evolve into the stylish and beautiful media that we
                see today. Since then, our visual culture has rapidly developed. Online consumers can only remember
                10-20% of the information they read. When you add imagery or other visual content, that number goes up
                to 65%.</p>
            <p>Bloggers now need to spend time creating the images that will “sell” their recipes to their viewers.
                Developing new recipes is not enough anymore.

                It doesn’t matter how great your recipe for dark chocolate cake is. If the image doesn’t pull the viewer
                in, you will have a hard time standing out.</p>
